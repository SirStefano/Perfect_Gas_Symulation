Simulation of perfect gas made with three.js library. Feel free to test at: https://perfect-gas-symulation.netlify.app
A few words about the project:
- The speed of molecules is created from Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann distribution
- For simplification mass=radius
- Pressure is sampling every one second
- Colors are different based on speed, the color pallet starting with blue(slow) and ending on red(fast)
- The absolute cap of molecules is 4000
Have fun with the simulation
